# Progress Bar System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive progress bar system for the Batch Renamer application. The system provides visual feedback for long-running operations, preventing the UI from appearing frozen and improving user experience.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ProgressWindow** (`batch_renamer/ui/progress_manager.py`)
   - Dedicated window for displaying progress bars
   - Prevents layout conflicts with the main application window
   - Modal window that centers on the parent window
   - Supports both determinate and indeterminate progress
   - Handles window close events and cancellation

2. **ProgressManager** (`batch_renamer/ui/progress_manager.py`)
   - Central component that manages progress window creation and lifecycle
   - Supports both determinate and indeterminate progress
   - Handles background threading to prevent UI freezing
   - Provides cancellation support
   - Manages window state and cleanup

3. **Main Window Integration** (`batch_renamer/ui/main_window.py`)
   - Integrates ProgressManager into the main application window
   - Provides convenience method `run_with_progress()` for easy usage

3. **Tool-Specific Progress Integration**
   - Database Logging: Import bank statements with progress
   - Bulk Rename: File processing with progress updates
   - PDF Unlock: PDF processing with progress tracking

## Features

### Progress Bar Types

1. **Determinate Progress**
   - Shows actual progress percentage (0-100%)
   - Used when the total number of items is known
   - Example: Processing a known number of files

2. **Indeterminate Progress**
   - Shows animated progress bar when total is unknown
   - Used for operations where progress cannot be measured
   - Example: Network operations, complex calculations

### User Interaction

- **Cancel Button**: Allows users to cancel long-running operations
- **Progress Messages**: Real-time updates showing current operation
- **Non-blocking**: UI remains responsive during operations

## Implementation Details

### ProgressWindow Class

```python
class ProgressWindow(ctk.CTkToplevel):
    def __init__(self, parent_window, title, determinate=True, can_cancel=True)
    def center_on_parent(self, parent_window)
    def update_progress(self, value, message=None)
    def update_message(self, message)
    def is_cancelled(self)
    def _on_cancel(self)
    def _on_close(self)
```

### ProgressManager Class

```python
class ProgressManager:
    def __init__(self, parent_window)
    def show_progress(self, title, determinate=True, can_cancel=True)
    def hide_progress(self)
    def update_progress(self, value, message=None)
    def update_message(self, message)
    def is_cancelled(self)
    def run_with_progress(self, operation, title, determinate, can_cancel)
```

### Usage Pattern

```python
# Simple usage
result = main_window.run_with_progress(
    lambda callback: my_operation(callback),
    title="Processing...",
    determinate=True,
    can_cancel=True
)

# Operation function signature
def my_operation(progress_callback):
    total_items = 100
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        # Update progress
        progress_value = (i + 1) / total_items
        if not progress_callback(progress_value, f"Processing {item}"):
            return None  # Cancelled
        # ... process item
    return result
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Database Logging - Bank Statement Import

**File**: `batch_renamer/tools/database_logging/import_manager.py`

- **Problem**: Importing bank statements from large folders caused UI freezing
- **Solution**: Added progress tracking for file scanning and database operations
- **Progress Updates**: 
  - File discovery phase
  - Individual file processing
  - Database insertion

### 2. Bulk Rename - File Processing

**File**: `batch_renamer/tools/bulk_rename/rename_logic.py`

- **Problem**: Renaming large numbers of files appeared frozen
- **Solution**: Added progress tracking for file analysis and rename operations
- **Progress Updates**:
  - File analysis phase
  - Rename execution phase

### 3. PDF Unlock - PDF Processing

**File**: `batch_renamer/tools/pdf_unlock/pdf_unlock_helper.py`

- **Problem**: Processing multiple PDFs showed no feedback
- **Solution**: Added progress tracking for PDF security removal
- **Progress Updates**:
  - Individual PDF processing
  - Security removal operations

## Technical Implementation

### Background Threading

- Operations run in background threads to prevent UI freezing
- Progress updates are safely communicated back to the main thread
- Cancellation is handled gracefully

### Progress Callback Pattern

```python
def progress_callback(value: float, message: Optional[str] = None) -> bool:
    """
    Update progress and check for cancellation.
    
    Args:
        value: Progress value between 0.0 and 1.0
        message: Optional message to display
        
    Returns:
        True to continue, False to cancel
    """
```

### Error Handling

- Exceptions in background operations are properly caught and re-raised
- Progress bar is automatically hidden on completion or error
- User is notified of failures through existing toast system

## Benefits

### User Experience Improvements

1. **No More Frozen UI**: Users can see that operations are progressing
2. **Cancellation Support**: Users can cancel long operations if needed
3. **Clear Feedback**: Real-time updates show exactly what's happening
4. **Professional Feel**: Modern applications provide progress feedback
5. **Clean Layout**: Progress window doesn't interfere with main application layout
6. **Modal Focus**: Progress window demands attention and prevents accidental interaction with main window

### Technical Benefits

1. **Non-blocking Operations**: UI remains responsive during long operations
2. **Consistent Interface**: All tools use the same progress system
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add progress bars to new operations
4. **Maintainable**: Centralized progress management
5. **Layout Isolation**: Progress window doesn't affect main application layout
6. **Window Management**: Proper modal behavior with focus and positioning

## Usage Examples

### Adding Progress to a New Operation

```python
# In your tool's frame class
def process_files(self):
    result = self.main_window.run_with_progress(
        lambda callback: self._process_files_with_progress(callback),
        title="Processing Files...",
        determinate=True,
        can_cancel=True
    )
    
    if result is None:
        # Operation was cancelled
        return
        
    # Handle result
    self.show_success_message(result)

def _process_files_with_progress(self, progress_callback):
    files = self.get_files_to_process()
    for i, file in enumerate(files):
        # Check for cancellation
        if not progress_callback(i / len(files), f"Processing {file}"):
            return None
            
        # Process the file
        self.process_single_file(file)
    
    return "Success"
```

## Testing

The progress bar system has been tested with:

1. **Determinate Progress**: File processing operations
2. **Indeterminate Progress**: Network-like operations
3. **Cancellation**: User-initiated cancellations
4. **Error Handling**: Exception scenarios
5. **UI Responsiveness**: Ensuring main UI remains interactive

## Future Enhancements

1. **Progress Persistence**: Save progress for very long operations
2. **Estimated Time**: Show estimated completion time
3. **Detailed Logging**: Log progress events for debugging
4. **Custom Themes**: Allow customization of progress bar appearance
5. **Batch Operations**: Support for multiple concurrent operations

## Conclusion

The progress bar system significantly improves the user experience by providing clear feedback during long-running operations. It prevents the application from appearing frozen and gives users control over operations through cancellation support. The implementation is robust, extensible, and follows modern UI/UX best practices.
